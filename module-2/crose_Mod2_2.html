<h1> Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2 </h1> 
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p class=“intro”> Hello my name is Aaron Crose. I usually go by Webb or Webbie because growing up this was the nickname my mom had for me. I am originally from Rock Island, IL. I currently reside in Shreveport, LA. </p>
<p> <span> I just recently moved to Shreveport this past month after living in Hungary for a year and a half.</span> My time in Europe was a lot of fun and I spent a lot of time traveling. My favorite trip was to Paphos, Cyprus a small island between Turkey and Greece. </p>
<p> My hobbies include basketball, working out, cooking, making music, and traveling. I have always been a big music fan and back in 2020 one of my new friends at the time taught me how to produce. When I feel a creative groove going then I’ll sit down to make a few songs. </p>
<p> I played basketball in college for a year before planning to transfer and then I just grew tired of school so I stopped going. I am back in school so that I can learn the skills to become a software developer and pair those with my IT background. I will be moving to Houston, TX next year and plan to live there for the long haul. </p>
